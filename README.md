Core implementation notes
- HTML
  - Use <button> for each question. Wrap answer content in a region with aria-hidden when collapsed.
  - Use data attributes to link buttons to panels for cleaner JS.
- CSS
  - Use CSS variables for colors, spacing, and breakpoints.
  - Use max-height transitions with a computed value in JS to allow smooth open/close.
  - Use prefers-reduced-motion to disable animation for users who set that preference.
- JavaScript
  - Minimal DOM operations: query selectors, class toggles, and inline style changes.
  - Use event delegation where sensible.
  - Keyboard handling:
    - Enter / Space: toggle focused item.
    - Arrow Up / Arrow Down: move focus to previous / next button.
    - Home / End: focus first / last button.
  - Theme toggle persists to localStorage. On load, script reads saved theme and applies it.

Accessibility checklist
- Each accordion button uses aria-expanded set to true/false.
- Each panel uses role="region" and aria-labelledby pointing to the button id.
- Keyboard navigation follows WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices for accordion widgets.
- Visible focus styles for keyboard users.
- Color contrast meets WCAG AA for text.

Performance and Lighthouse tips
- Keep CSS and JS files small. This project bundles minimal code.
- Use proper caching headers on your host.
- Use critical CSS for above-the-fold content when you scale the project.
- Use SVG icons inline or as a sprite for smaller payload.
- Test with Lighthouse and address any accessibility or best-practice flags.

Theme toggle
- The project uses CSS variables for color and a simple toggle button.
- Theme selection persists in localStorage under key "fm-faq-theme".
- The theme script toggles a data-theme attribute on <html> and updates the toggle button label.

Testing checklist
- Manual:
  - Run on desktop and mobile widths.
  - Test with keyboard only navigation.
  - Disable JS to see accessible baseline content.
- Automated:
  - Run Lighthouse for performance and accessibility.
  - Use axe-core for automated accessibility checks.
  - Run Lighthouse in CI for regression detection.

Deployment
- Host as a static site.
- Recommended hosts:
  - Netlify: drag and drop the publish folder or connect the repo.
  - GitHub Pages: use the docs or main branch.
  - Vercel: connect the repo and deploy.

Tips for pixel-perfect match
- Use the original design's base font and spacing tokens.
- Use precise line-height and letter-spacing for headings.
- Use the provided mockup image as a background reference and compare with overlay tools.

Files to look at first
- index.html â€” start here to see the markup.
- scripts/accordion.js â€” core behavior for toggle and keyboard.
- styles/components/accordion.css â€” transitions and responsive rules.

Common issues
- If panels jump during open/close, ensure JS sets max-height computed from scrollHeight.
- If keyboard arrows skip items, ensure all question buttons are focusable and in DOM order.
- If theme does not persist, check localStorage permissions in the browser.

Fork, build, and ship your version.
